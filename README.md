## About me

My name is Yi Gu, a master student from Robotics Institute at CMU.  I got a bachelor degree in both Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan. My research focus is reinforcement learning and motion planning.

## What I hope to learn

I would like to learn how to manage data more efficiently with the help of visualization. It is extremely helpful for people to understand and interpret data, especially for machine learning research.
