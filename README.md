# About me

My name is Yi Gu, a master student from Robotics Institute at CMU.  I got a bachelor degree in both Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan. My research focus is reinforcement learning and motion planning. 

# What I hope to learn

I would like to learn how to manage data more efficiently with the help of visualization. It is extremely helpful for people to understand and interpret data, especially for machine learning research.

[Government Debt Visualization](/dataviz2.md)


Here is my visualization of government debt around the world from 1985 to 2019. If you are interested in the data, feel free to go to the source page for more questions.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5296524"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


I tried another chart type, called column chart to create another visualization, which is presented as follows:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5296645"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


These three visualizations use the same data but with differnent focus on the idea they try to convey. The first chart generated from OECD data website describes the general government debt for the countries around the world in 2019 only. It is simple and clear to check the debt for each present country, and compare one with another about the debt to GDP ratio. However, we have no idea about the debt to GDP ratio trends of each country for some year. This is presented by the grid line of line charts. With this advantage, the second graph cannot provide convenience when comparing debt ratio of one country with one of another country. 

Why I choose column chart is that line charts are often used to display data or information that changes continuously over time, while column chars provide a visual display for comparing quantities in different years for each country. We can still observe the trends through column charts with emphasizing the difference between debt ratio for different year.
