# Outline

## Summary

Suicide is a heavy topic, the number of of which is cold. Care should have temperature, requiring the warmth from the whole society. The reason why I choose the topic "suicides in China" is that I want to find out how depression influence peoples' thoughts about life, why they choose to suicide, and also what the trends will be. It is intended to arouse people's attention to mental health in China.

## Project Structure

- How many people choose to suicide in China from 2005? What's the trend of suicide rate?
- Does gender impact the suicide rates?
- Is where they live related?
- What's the difference of suicides percentage between different age groups?

## The data

The data that I used for the final project are primarily from [WHO Global Health Observatory data repository](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.MHSUICIDEv?lang=en) and [Chinese Health Database](http://www.epschinadata.com/data-resource.html) on EPS China Data.

I will use the data to show the number of suicides and suicide rates from years to years. Also I will also include the comparsion between genders and living areas.

## Method and Medium

I am going to use the Shorthand to build the story that I want to tell. First, I will talk about the general trends of the suicide rates from 2005 to 2019. Then, I will compare the sucide rates based on gender and living areas. I will also analyze the relation between sucide rates and ages. With discussion of the graphs, I might come to some conclusion. The most important idea that I want to emphasize is to take care of ourselves, no matter what the data tell us.

## User research and Interviews

1. Target Audience: Chinese Adults and little knowledge about data visualization

2. The sample is limited to three Chinese students with different education background. They live in different cities or even countries in the world. They all have at least bachelors degree.
