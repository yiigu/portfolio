# [Part III](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/yigu/index.html)

## Summary

1. Brainstormed for an interesting topic: suicides in China is increasing from year to year. People need to pay attention to mental health.

2. Wrote a rough story that I want to tell. What affect the suicides rate? Gender, Living areas, ages?

3. Without data, created intial sketches.

4. Searched online to find the relevant data. I found another [one](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide) here after Part II.

5. Chose shorthand as the method to build the story.

6. Created the wireframe to tell the data

7. Interviewed three people for their feedback

8. Improved the wireframe

9. Began to work on the real data. I found the data is not what I expected.

10. Come up with another story: why suicide decline in China?

11. Created a different wireframe

12. Worked with shorthand to tell the story.

13. Presentation and got some feedback. Improved the story on shorthand again, including adding more text, citation and remove images by google searching.

## Reflection

When I was working on Part II of the final project, I realized that the data of Chinese suicide rates was not what I expected. Previously, I thought there are a lot of people killing themselves, and the trend of the suicide rate is increasing. But the fact is that the suicide rate of China is one of the lowest one in the world. That is a different story I want to tell.

Based on the data, I switched from why more and more people choose to commit suicide to a dramatic decline in Chinese suicides. As I have mentioned in Part II, I was going to talk about huge burden people take, the impact about gender or living areas. But when I found the opposite conclusion, I thought it was so terrible and became so sad about it. However, it popped to my mind: why just explain fewer people kill themselves through the years. 

Then I started to do some reaseach about it. There are several reasons to make up for it. The details are shown [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/yigu/index.html).
